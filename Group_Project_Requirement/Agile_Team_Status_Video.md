# Agile - Team Status Video

Keeping your stake holders and bosses informed about the status of your project is an important aspect of software projects.  In the absence of information people create narratives about what is going on.  This is very dangerous for dev teams so it is important that you are transparent about your project and team status to reduce political problems in your team and broader organization.  To this end Status Meetings and presentations are often held in industry to give insight about how things are going.

Since you have just completed your first sprint and hopefully might have your first "walking skeleton" of an app and functional build pipeline it is time to show off our accomplishment.  To show off your hard work make a short 4 minute or less video (MP4 or Quicktime format) that presents the status of your software, the function of your pipeline and the health of your team.  You should also be transparent about any challenges you are facing which may have arising in your retrospective.  Finally conclude your video with a preview about what the next sprint will tackle and what stakeholders should look forward to after the next sprint.

Your video should live in you repo at /admin/videos/statusvideo1.mp4 (whether or not the video is ever uploaded to YouTube, please get the original asset here in the repo).   A second video after the next sprint will be placed in the same directory with the name statusvideo2

Note: You will have a second status video after the next major sprint and the last video for final turn-in as well so consider this video a practice run on presenting your information.

You will upload your first video by 11/22 at 11:59 pm PST and on 11/23 we will be reviewing in class a selection of videos so make sure you present yourself well!
