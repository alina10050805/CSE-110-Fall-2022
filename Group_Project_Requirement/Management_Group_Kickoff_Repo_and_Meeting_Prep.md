# Management - Group Kickoff, Repo and Meeting Prep

Meetings are inevitable in Software Engineering.  Running meetings well sadly is not inevitable.  The purpose of this assignment is to help you try to figure out how to run an ad hoc meeting properly.  A later assignment will address stand-up meetings which will be handled differently.

## Kickoff Meeting
As you have just formed your groups you probably need to have a serious meeting to define roles, set up some rules of the development and develop your team contract (see other assignment).  To start this process you should hold a kick-off meeting.  

Schedule your Kickoff Meeting well before the assignment due date and try to address the ideas necessary to run the team as you understand them. 

Try to define a structure to your meeting such as how you will start them (for example, review the agenda), followed by a set of points to address, and then a conclusion (take-away points). Note that this is just a loose example, yours can differ however you see fit, but feel free to use this as a jumping off point. If you seem to be stuck, search online for "Meeting minutes examples". You are required to capture notes in all meetings, this one included. In your meeting notes, make sure to mark down the type of meeting, the attendance (marking who is and isn't there), the time/place of the meeting, the agenda, items for future investigation and any decisions made (If there was some discussion before a decision was made, include the key points/reasoning).  Take your notes in Markdown format. Name your file the date-topic.md (mmddyy-topic.md).  For example **011621-kickoff.md**.

## GitHub Repo
One of your members will need to create an Organization on GitHub and add your team members and your mentor TA to it. The organization should be called cse110-sp21-groupX where X is your team number (e.g. **cse110-sp21-group11**). You should then create a repository in that organization with the same name that will serve as our single source of truth. In your repository you should make the following directories:

**/admin**

**/admin/meetings**

**/source**

**/specs**

Keep your meeting notes in the appropriate **/admin/meetings** directory.

You should also create a **README.md** file in the root (/) of your repository with a short description of the project. This will serve as the landing page for your project and should be updated as you add code, tests, documentation and other important artifacts.

Make sure you invite your team mentor (TA) as an administrative collaborator on your GitHub project.

Submit the link to your repo so the TA can check your meeting notes and repository set-up. Consider format, details, and content of meeting important for the full 3 points.


 

### Q&A

**Q. Can our group hold this meeting at the same time we do our group bonding activity?**

A. You may hold them one after the other if you so choose, but you may not mix the two. If you choose to do this, I would recommend holding this meeting first as it will require more focus and planning.

 

**Q. I'm unsure of how to structure my team's meeting minutes**

A. Search online for examples of "Meeting minutes", you'll want to make sure to include

* Team number / team name
* Type of meeting held
* Which members are present / absent
* When & Where the meeting was held
* The agenda of what is discussed
    * Any old unresolved business from the previous meeting
    * Any new business to be discussed
    * Anything that was on the agenda but was not discussed (save for next meeting's old business)
* Any decisions made & their reasoning (if there were dissenting opinions include them, then write why the group decided to make that decision anyways)
* When the meeting finished

There's some good information about managing project communications here as well

**Q. Are the decisions we make in this meeting final? Even if we wrote it down in our notes?**

A. No, you are allowed to change things as you see fit. If you want to change positions with another group member you are free to do so, but you are not required. If you want to change the process because what you decided is not working, you are also free to do so. That being said, healthy, functioning groups take the time to think things out before hand so things don't have to change as much down the line, so make sure to put some effort in now so it can pay off later.
