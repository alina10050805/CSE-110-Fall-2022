# Final Project Video - Public Version

The class is over and it is time to show the world what you have done.  We don't have a lot of time in our final exam period, but we have time to show around 4mins of a video (+/- 30seconds) that can let everyone know what you did and how well your project went.   For bragging rights and sharing lessons learned produce a video no longer than 4:30s and no shorter than 3:30s that covers the following

* Team Name and Number
* Brief mention on video or with a picture of each member and their role(s)
* A quick tour of your product (make that part sizzle to show off any features or things you are proud of)
* A brief retrospective of what challenges you faced, what things you felt you overcame and anything you feel you would do differently now that you are done
* Conclude your video with a brief point of advice for the next students (victims) of 110 projects so they crush the project

You are free to make your video humorous and style it any way you like as long as you believe it won't offend anyone.  Have fun with this as we are going to vote for the ones we like the best in the final exam and the top three videos will get some bonus points (and of course bragging rights).  A second video will be also be due, and you can find details in its assignment; that video does not have to be polished and will be more informational and only viewed by the TAs and Prof.

Please make your video accessible with a link and submit that here. The video should also be accessible from your repository. You may have trouble with uploading to GitHub given the file sizes so we recommend uploading to YouTube and leaving it unlisted.
