# Starting Pitch

Your project should be carefully considered before starting given that we have about 5-6 weeks of total available time and far less given the other commitments we have in life and school.  The [Shape Up book](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) from the folks behind [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) provides a very useful way of thinking about shaping your work to fit the constraints that you face.  If you performed your brainstorming activity properly you should be ready to quickly shape your work to fit the time available to your team.  


First make sure you have read the book which is freely available online.  Your whole team should at least skim it.  The main effort here is that you should clearly aim to articulate risks, rabbit holes, and have a clear definition of what you are going to do in the form of wireframes. 

Note: the book talks about fat marker sketches, but we are going to suggest a bit more clarity on the effort given what you have done brainstorming wise.

You should take your thoughts and form a pitch document that you will present to your team mentor for approval.  The pitch document should contain the topics of risks and rabbit holes as well as a visual representation of what you are doing in the form of system diagrams and wireframes.  However, our pitch should also have a statement of purpose as well as a section on user personas.  The pitch may take the form of a slide deck (PDF) of no more than 16 slides or a document (PDF file) of no more than 8 pages.  We would prefer to see these documents in markdown form for easy modification, but we will allow a final PDF asset as well.  Full page diagrams for specs will not count towards your page or slide totals.  The limitation is just to keep you focused and to not over specify your project, as things will likely change as you go.

Once you have completed your pitch schedule some time to present the plan to your mentor for review.  Note that the mentor may require changes so meet as quickly as you are ready, as you will be gated from breaking code ground until the pitch is approved.  

The pitch documents should be placed in your repo in /specs/pitch.  Note that other documents such as interfaces, use cases, etc. can live in the directories specified in the brainstorming assignment.
