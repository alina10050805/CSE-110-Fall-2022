# Management - Group Contract

As we have heard in the group lectures as well as what Google found in their study running a team requires a certain degree of trust and clarity.  To improve the chances that your team thrives, we should establish some rules for our group. 

To make it clear as to what we should do as a team, we need to write down our rules in some document that is stored in our repository.  The document we need to create is called a team working agreement, sometimes referred to as a team contract.  Whatever the name, it should include the following:

* Definition of what is expected to be on the team
* Definition of how to address situations where group "rules" are not being followed

Some information on a Team Contract as well as other Engineering documentation can be found here - https://ohiostate.pressbooks.pub/feptechcomm/chapter/7-project-communications/

There are other forms you may adopt as well, this is just a starting off point.  The main issue we will look for is clarity of your group's "rules" and actually agreement to them.  Your kickoff meeting would be a good place to debate what goes in this document (rules.md) and task out any research or writing to complete it.  To verify agreement to what the contract defines, every group member will have to upload a signed copy (PDF) of the rules to the repo.

Place your team rules in your repo at **/admin/misc/rules.md** and then each member should add their version named as **/admin/misc/rules-studentname.pdf** and it should include a signed version of the printed rules.   If I was on your team my file would **/admin/misc/rules-thomaspowell.pdf** as an example of the format.

Upload a screen capture of the section of your repo with ALL the executed documents and rules.  The TAs will then verify them and review the rules in your repo.
