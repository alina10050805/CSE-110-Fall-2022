# Final Project Video - Private Version

The class is over and it is time to hand-off our work to others and have an honest look at what we did well and not so well in our Agile development practices.  To communicate information both to the graders and to a person who might take over your project at a future date you should make a video (shorter than 15 minutes, and longer than 6 minutes) to help us understand your project, pipeline, and team effort.  This video does not have to be fancy or polished, but it might be wise to at least have a nice title and conclusion section for presentation consistency.

Your private video should follow this format

* Team Name and Number
* Each team member should be present and in their own words state what they did on the project, what they are proud of and what they feel they could improve upon or address beyond the class (assume around ~30seconds per member)
* A video discussion about how to access your repo, a tour of the repo organization and a demonstration of making a small change to the repo and the completion of the build process.  You may need to write more detailed discussion of building or onboarding the product than the video supports.  If so create a markdown file called "onboard.md" and put it in your documentation which goes into more details.
* A more involved retrospective about how your Agile practices were conducted and what challenges and victories the team faced.  Honesty is the best course of action here as we are more likely to be lenient if we understand you are aware of what you didn't do well on the project and practices.  
* Conclude your video with a discussion of what things a team taking on your project should do next.  Discuss the features not built yet, improvements to the build pipeline or anything else you would have gotten to given another quarter worth of work.

Do not make this video in a marketing or humor sense, be informational and candid.  Remember this video is for grading and will not be shown to your fellow Fall 110 students.  

Please make your video accessible with a link and submit that here. The video should also be accessible from your repository. You may have trouble with uploading to GitHub given the file sizes so we recommend uploading to YouTube and leaving it unlisted.
