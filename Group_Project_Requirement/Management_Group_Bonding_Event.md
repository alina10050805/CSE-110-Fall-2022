# Management - Group Bonding Event

In order to work effectively as a team and build a sense of psychological safety, it is important that you know one another on a bit of a personal level. This is why as your first team assignment we are having you conduct a group bonding activity of your choice. There are no strict requirements for what this activity has to be, and it doesn't have a required length of time, but we recommend at least an hour or so. The goal of this assignment is for it to be fun, relaxed, and lighthearted, so don't stress about the details too much

 

Below are some ideas for your group activity (you are free to do any activity you please, don't feel bound to the ones below):

* https://www.quizbreaker.com/
* Among Us
* Screen sharing a Jackbox game on Steam (if a group member already has one)
