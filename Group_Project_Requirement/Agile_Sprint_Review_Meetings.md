# Agile - Sprint Review Meetings

A common meeting ceremony in Agile is held to review the sprint to see what has been accomplished.  This ceremony is usually called a sprint review meeting and it serves as a time for team members to "show and tell" what has been accomplished.  Very often stake holders and managers will be invited to this meeting to see the progress made. 

Do note that the purpose of this meeting is to go over work accomplishment and not to criticize or correct the agile process.  Process review and improvement is the main purpose of the retrospective activity and is covered in a separate assignment.

You should hold the sprint review meeting at the conclusion of the sprint (Friday, Saturday or Sunday) and allocate at least 30mins to do so.  Each member should attend and speak in the meeting and notes, screen captures or even demo videos should be taken.  Attendance should be noted in your meeting notes and the high points saved in a markdown file in your repo (**/admin/meetings/MMDDYY-sprint-X-review.md where X is the sprint number**).  

**This meeting should happen before the Retrospective meeting.**  Teams may find it logistically appropriate to run the sprint review meeting, take a break and then run the retrospective meeting so they can use time efficiently.  However, like most of the agile ceremonies you decide to hold your meetings is up to you except the order which should be followed.

Your submission is into your repo and you should alert your team mentor that is placed before the required time so they can review and grade the effort and adherence to the ceremony.

Note: The raw materials from these two meeting will be need for your Status Video assignment which is published separately. 

This assignment will have two submissions after each of the two larger sprints. 

* The first submission is due by 11/14
* The second submission is due by 11/29

A final review will be applied at the conclusion of the project and will have a separate grade.
