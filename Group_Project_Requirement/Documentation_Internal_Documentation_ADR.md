# Documentation - Internal Documentation : ADR (Architectural Decision Records)

Big decisions should be recorded to avoid organizational debt.  Unfortunately important decisions are often made in meetings, in chat, video conferences, power point decks, etc.  Consensus may be reached via these interactions or artifacts but preservation of the decisions is often lost over time particularly if team members move on.  To address the erosion of shared understanding of decisions SEs are encouraged to document key decisions in the form Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).  In the course since we are keeping everything in our repo the [ADR in markdown](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

You will store all our decisions in our repo in **/specs/adrs** (though you may also publish them internally to your Wiki).  Each decision should be an individual document and should be named the topic and a date to sort the decisions.  A name format like MMDDYY-Decision-Name.md would help you keep the decisions in a set order.  Make sure you use the template format of the site above for a shared format between teams.

At the end of the quarter we will read over the ADRs you have and make sure they are relevant to what you did.  If you make one and undo the choice later on that should be noted in the document itself at the top and include when the change happened, a brief reason why the change was a made, and a link to any superseding decision document.

**A minimum of 3 ADRs should be found in your repository, though there is no maximum.  ADRs should be added as you go along, not after the project is being completed.**  We will be checking the time when the documents are added so if they are all added at the very end of a project post hoc minimal points will be awarded as you did not follow the intention of the process.

 

There will be two checkpoints of ADRs

* Checkpoint 1 - due in repo by 11/13
* Checkpoint 2 - due in repo by 11/22

Final checkpoint will be on your project review (final exam date)
