# Agile - Retrospective

An important aspect of agile processes is the idea of running retrospectives at the conclusion of each sprint.  Retrospectives are covered in the slides and there many links online that will explain retrospectives such as [this](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/5-things-you-need-know-facilitate-retrospective) and [this](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/projects/leadership-team-management/how-run-sprint-retrospective/)

Given the necessity to run various activities to make the retrospective safe and also useful I suggest using a tool.  A simple tool like Miro has templates and with a little planning you can run one, but a more specialized tool like [Retrium is probably better](https://www.retrium.com/).

I include a video for you I recorded for a previous offering of CSE 112 that shows how Retrium works and team leaders or whomever is going to facilitate the meeting should review it before running your first retro.

Note: Even if you don't end up using Retrium the video is useful to review as it explains the ceremony and various activities you may run.

Once you have run your retrospective your meeting notes should be collected and put into your repo.   You should create a file named MMDDYY-retrospective.md and keep it in you repo with your other efforts.  If you are publishing such files to your Wiki or other areas go ahead and do that as well.  

Make sure to note high points and keep artifacts from your retrospective for your sprint planning and to include in your Status Video which is a separate assignment.  

**Important Note:  You must perform your retrospective meeting BEFORE you start your next sprint and after you have done your sprint review meeting. **

There will be two retrospective submissions performed one after each sprint.  

* Sprint Retro 1 - due in repo by 11/14
* Spring Retro 2 - due in repo by 11/29
