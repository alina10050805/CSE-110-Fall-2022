# Management - Branding, Group Page and Video

## Team Brand
An important part of team forming is developing a team identity and brand. Your will need to choose a team name and build a brand or theme around it. Branding materials could include (don't feel pressured to do all of these) team colors, a logo, a mascot, custom fonts, power point themes, etc. You should use these branding materials on future presentations and assignments to reinforce your team identity to the class. Additionally you should set your slack workspace icon to an image that represents your brand and also incorporates your team number prominently.

## Team Page
In a previous lab exercise you made individual developer pages; now it is time to make one for your team.  This page will be for internal documentation, so ordinarily we would use a Wiki as opposed to GitHub Pages for your project since they are more internally focused.  Since Wikis are a paid feature for teams however, you'll just create a Markdown page in your /admin folder called **team.md**. You should link to this file from the README.md in your repository root.

Your team page should have the team name, brand, any values you think are important, and a roster of all the team members.  The roster should provide a brief overview of each member with a link to their personal Github page.  The team page can include humor or whatever culture makes sense to your team, but keep it reasonable as it may be shown to others. 

## Team Intro Video
You also should make a small 2.5 minute (max) video (MP4 or Quicktime format) that introduces your team.  Again, have fun with this as you see fit.  Each TA will pick the best video of their group to show in class and that team will receive bonus points for the selection so there is an incentive to excel here.

Your video should live in you repo at /admin/videos/teamintro.mp4 (whether or not the video is ever uploaded to YouTube, please get the original asset here in the repo, compressed if necessary).


## Turn ins
* Keep your team branding materials in your repo at /admin/branding
* Set your slack workspace icon to represent your brand and team number
* Place your team page at /admin/team.md and link to it from your README
* Place your team video at /admin/videos/teamintro.mp4

The pages and the movie are graded individually so make sure each is addressed for maximal points. The branding materials and slack icon will not be graded but your TA mentors will ask about them during your first check in.
