# Brainstorming Activity

In order to figure out what you should actually build with enough precision, that it is likely to be successful, a non-trivial time needs to be spent on pondering the form and project approach to your project.

To demonstrate that you understand this potential SE stage, teams should schedule at least 1 (but as many as they require) brainstorming meetings.  The brainstorming effort should be at minimum 2 hours in length and be documented in terms of attendance, time, tool/location.  The class suggested tool for Brainstorming in a remote condition is Miro Links to an external site.which provides both whiteboarding and remote collaboration features to conduct this process.  You are not required to use Miro though and may use another tool if it works better for your team.  Regardless of how you perform your brainstorming effort, to define the problem you must save the following artifacts in your project repository.

**/admin/meetings/mmddyy-brainstorm.md** (there may be multiple of these)  - these are the general meeting notes of the brainstorming summarized including attendance, etc.  Note this may be more exhaustive and procedural as opposed to what will be found in the planning document

**/specs/brainstorm/** will continue the distilled documents and diagrams you produced of the ideas you want to capture from your meetings.  If you used Miro or another tool export the contents as an image, PDF, or markdown file to capture your appropriate assets.

We don't want to tell you specifically what to discuss, but you should be narrowing down the problem you're solving and what features a system would need to address it. There are many ways you could do this: clarifying definitions and requirements, thinking about users and their expectations, deciding on your app's theme or mood, etc. It might also be helpful to "survey your competition." We're looking for evidence that you've sufficiently pondered your problem before diving into visual and technical design.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Related team assignments will add specific form to what we should capture in our project but we preview them here so that as you brainstorm, you consider many topics.  These will be required late next week.  These are not finalized **at this initial stage of submission**, but are provided for guidance to start on them.  Do not read this as not doing them yet, read this as the final checking of these artifacts does not happen immediately.

* **Project Pitch** - we will produce a project pitch that will be presented to your team mentor for sign-off.  We will use the ideas from [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) to guide this process.  Teams looking to get ahead are advised to read this book now.

* **Overarching Decisions** - we will eventually capture these as an [ADR in markdown](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (**/specs/adrs** will contain an individual document per major decision.  There will be some initial ones that have to do with general project plan and approach, but more may be added as the project goes on.  The main point of this capture is to explain why choices are made.  As brainstorming may have your team settle on choices quickly capturing them in a document may be better than just mental consensus) 

* **User Centered Thinking Documents** - we will produce [personas](http://opendesignkit.org/methods/personas/), [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story), and potentially [use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) (**/specs/users** will contain this but user stories chosen will also be represented as issues to work on)

* **System Diagrams** - we will eventually capture how your app will be decomposed in [C4 diagram](https://c4model.com/), [event modeling diagram](https://eventmodeling.org/posts/what-is-event-modeling/), or [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language#Diagrams) form

* **Interface Design Documents** - we will initially capture "fat marker design" later extended with wireframes and high fidelity prototypes (**/specs/interface/rough, /specs/interface/wireframes, /specs/interface/highfidelity**  These directories may contain single or multitude of documents)

* **Project Roadmap** - we will capture a roadmap of how the product will evolve both here in the quarter as well as ideas of how it might grow beyond the time we have with  (**/specs/roadmap.md**)
